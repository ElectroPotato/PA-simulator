# PA-simulator

* Simulator assumes optimal play as desribed by guide provided in this image. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5CzhbRXEAEB-XH.jpg
* Simulator also assumes perfect timing such that no time-gated or capped resources are wasted.
* nTrials: Edit this number to change the number of PA playthroughs to simulate
* Variables a-f: Starting conditions for the simulation, as described by in-text comments



## Notes:

* 1 extra surplus impulses corresponds to approximately an additional 0.5-1.0% chance to capture the 3* unit by the end of the cycle
* 1 extra Svarog aid commission corresponds to approximately 1.5-2.0$ chance to capture the 3* unit by the end of the cycle
* On average, approximately 30% of users will capture the 3* unit within 28 days, while 70% of users will see the 3* unit on the field at least once

A meta-analysis would be required to further properly quantify the significance of using impulses and aid commisions at levels that are higher than that which can be expected of a free to play user
